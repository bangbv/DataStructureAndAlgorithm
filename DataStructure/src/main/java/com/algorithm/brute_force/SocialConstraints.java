There are 0 < n ≤ 8 movie goers. 
They will sit in the front row in n consecutive open seats. 
There are 0 ≤ m ≤ 20 seating constraints among them, i.e.
movie goer a and movie goer b must be at most (or at least) c seats apart. 
The question is simple: How many possible seating arrangements are there?
